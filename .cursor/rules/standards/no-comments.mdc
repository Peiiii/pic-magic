# No Comments Rule

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never Add Comments

**NEVER add comments to code unless the user explicitly requests it.**

## Strict Requirements

### 1. **No Automatic Comments**
- **NEVER add comments** automatically for any reason
- **NEVER add comments** to explain code logic
- **NEVER add comments** to document functions or components
- **NEVER add comments** to improve code readability
- **NEVER add comments** as part of refactoring or optimization

### 2. **Only Add Comments When**
- User explicitly says "add comments" or "添加注释"
- User specifically requests documentation
- User asks for code explanation in comments
- User uses commands like `/comment` or `/document`

### 3. **What Counts as Comments**
- `// Single line comments`
- `/* Multi-line comments */`
- `/** JSDoc comments */`
- `# Shell comments`
- `<!-- HTML comments -->`
- `/* CSS comments */`
- Any text meant to explain code without affecting functionality

### 4. **Code Quality Without Comments**
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Use descriptive function and component names
- Structure code logically and clearly
- Use TypeScript types for better code understanding
- Follow established naming conventions

### 5. **Examples**

#### ❌ WRONG - Adding comments automatically
```typescript
// This function calculates the total price
function calculateTotal(price: number, tax: number): number {
  // Add tax to the base price
  return price + tax;
}
```

#### ✅ CORRECT - No comments unless requested
```typescript
function calculateTotal(price: number, tax: number): number {
  return price + tax;
}
```

#### ✅ CORRECT - Only when user requests
```typescript
// User requested: "add comments to explain this function"
function calculateTotal(price: number, tax: number): number {
  // Calculate the total price including tax
  return price + tax;
}
```

## Rule Enforcement

- **This rule is ALWAYS ACTIVE**
- **No exceptions** without explicit user override
- **Every code change** must respect this rule
- **Violation is a serious error** that must be corrected

## User Override Commands

When user explicitly requests comments:
- "add comments" or "添加注释"
- "document this code"
- "explain in comments"
- "add JSDoc comments"
- Any explicit comment request

**Remember**: Clean, self-documenting code is better than commented code. Only add comments when the user specifically asks for them.
